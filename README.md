Introduction:
At Sunflowers Hub, we pride ourselves on helping businesses unlock their full potential through data-driven insights. One of our most exciting recent projects involved working with PulseTech Healthcare, a leader in medical device innovation. Using advanced business analysis techniques, we delivered actionable recommendations to help PulseTech refine their products, expand into untapped markets, and optimize their strategies for sustainable growth.

The challenge:
PulseTech approached us with a clear goal: to better understand their operational, user, and market data. They needed insights that could guide their decision-making, from improving product features to identifying high-potential markets. Our task was to transform raw datasets into meaningful, strategic insights that would directly impact their revenue, user satisfaction, and market share.
